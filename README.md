# Typing practice

TODO:
Progression:

- current speed building up to target speed
- when reached and sustained for some time - enable new letter, starting from home row
- statistics, keeping track of the most frequently mistyped letters
- if 3 words are missed, restart current "run" (start with the same letter with base speed)
- hardcore mode - one mistyped letter ends the "run"
